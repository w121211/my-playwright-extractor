Create a new prompt to guide an ai agent to write json selector
1. goal is ask agent to write json selector for a specified ai assistant site
the schema is defined in @types.ts AiAssistantPageSpec AiAssistantSiteSpec
example: @ai_assistant.json
2. agent may have a direct access to the browser (browser agent) or use playwright mcp, so you should create two versions of prompt

3. rough steps
- navigate to the web page user specified (playwright) or user give the web page directly (browser agent)
- for the page, write selector json based on the schema
- for each selector, should test directly using page's dom tools (no need to give tool names)
- try to find the selector that is robust and versatile (won't break easily)
- ask any questions if not clear before start
- some selectors may not be found (for example, it does not exist in the page at all)
- sometimes, the page need user login to get complete page, so stop work anytime if you find unsure, or need user's support
- present the work result, and also report for selectors could not be found, and wait for user feedback
- loop

4. for the prompt, also include the user's request skeleton in the end, so user can quickly copy and fill the prompt to start
