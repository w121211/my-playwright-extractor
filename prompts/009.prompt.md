Write a script in src/tools

Goal: using playwright to save page snapshot and html as fixture files for later testing 
- open a headed playwright browser, let user operate
- save every page's snapshot/html when browsing (you should monitor the url change, and page state changes for example)
- provide a hot key to allow user can save current page manually

- avoid over-engineering
